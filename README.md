## Google authentication in flutter using GetX

<details>
<summary>Setup flutter app with <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_core">firebase</a> for google <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_auth">authentication</a> using <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/get">getx</a> package</summary>
<br>

When you run the project, at that time there will be a home screen; it will check whether the user is authenticated or not; if the user is authenticated, then the user will move to the welcome screen where the user's profile is displayed; if the user is not authenticated, then from the home screen, the user will move to the login screen- where the user will make a login and after that the user will move to the welcome screen.
